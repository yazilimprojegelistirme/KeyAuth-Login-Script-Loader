## How It Works

The KeyAuth Login Script Loader interacts with the KeyAuth API to perform the following actions:

1. **License Check**: When a user attempts to log in, the script sends a request to the KeyAuth API to check the validity of the provided license key.
  
2. **User Authentication**: If the license is valid, the script proceeds to authenticate the user using their username and password.

3. **Information Retrieval**: Upon successful authentication, the script fetches user-specific data from the API and displays it in the console.

4. **Menu and Animation**: The script features a customizable menu and loading animations to enhance user experience.
